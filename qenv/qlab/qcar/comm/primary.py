class ControlSocket(ServiceModule):
    """
    A network communication class that handles socket connections to a remote device.

    This class is responsible for establishing a socket connection, sending and receiving data,
    and handling reconnections in case of connection interruptions.

    Attributes:
        host_name (str): The hostname or IP address of the remote device.
        port (int): The port number to connect to on the remote device.
        retry_count (int): Counter for the number of reconnection attempts.

    Methods:
        setup(): Establishes the socket connection with the remote device.
        terminate(): Closes the socket connection.
        reconnect(queue_lock: Lock, queue: Queue): Attempts to re-establish the connection and retry the operation.
        execute(queue_lock: Lock, control_queue: Queue): Sends data from the control_queue to the remote device and receives a response.
